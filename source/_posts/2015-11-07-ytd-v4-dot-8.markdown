With this new version, I'm limiting the access to the external (removable) sdcard in devices where it's not directly writable (but would need a procedure that I still have to implement) and I'm fixing a bug I accidentally introduced in v4.7.

CHANGELOG:

     v4.8 - Nov 6 2015
    -----------------------------------
    [x] always use system file-chooser, on Lollipop or above, with extSdCard not present or not
        (directly) writable
    [x] fixed a bug introduced in previous version, causing custom download folder to change into
        private app's data folder
