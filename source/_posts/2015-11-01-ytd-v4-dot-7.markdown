Hello,
a new build for YTD is available, moving all features tested into the latest beta into this stable version.

CHANGELOG:

     v4.7 - Nov 1 2015
    -----------------------------------
    [x] new FFmpeg builds (from v2.8) extending support to 64bit CPUs
    [x] force FFmpeg's version check when the ROM has been updated
    [x] ask the permission to write on the sdcard (on M devices)
    [x] fixed filechooser checkbox issue for multiple selection
    [x] option to use wi-fi connection only

A lot of work has to be done, still. Probably development will slow down a bit due to many *real life/job* commitments, sorry.
I really hope I'll soon be able to post an initial beta from the multi-thread development branch. This will speed-up downloads up to 4X. But unfortunately the feature is not stable nor completed.

In the mean time, stay tuned, follow the XDA threads and, over anything else, I would like to thank everyone that is showing support through the PayPal donations. 
I really appreciate that.
