Hello everyone.
YouTube recently changed something on its site and the app needed to be fixed.
With this version I'm also bringing in the few changes made for tha latest beta.

Many thanks to *mad_ady* and *nixxo* from the [wdlxtv forum](http://forum.wdlxtv.com/) for their help.

**Changelog:**

     v5.2 - Feb 01 2017
    -----------------------------------
    [x] encrypted signature patch (14) (thanks mad_ady and nixxo)
    [x] wrap .opus audio files into .ogg container for better support (thanks Georgi P.)
    [x] small bug fix in dashboard json file
    [x] drop support for FLV videos, no more available

Download the apk [from this blog](http://dentex.github.io/files/apk/latest/dentex.youtube.downloader.apk) or use the in-app update from settings.

Bye!
