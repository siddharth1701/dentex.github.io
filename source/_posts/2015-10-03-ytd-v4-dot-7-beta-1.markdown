Hello,    
Today I'm releasing a beta version for YTD to test some new FFmpeg builds. The binaries have been updated to the latest version 2.8 of FFmpeg's source and have been fine-tuned for **Lollipop** and **M** android versions, maintaining full compatibility and reliability (hopefully) with previous versions, down to ICS, that is the last API supported by YTD. 

Also, devices with a 64bit CPU, both *arm* and *x86*, now can use the 32bit FFmpeg builds and do not appear as "unsupported" anymore (I simply made the 64bit CPUs to use the 32bit builds).

So, the short *changelog* is:

     v4.7 Beta 1 - Oct 3 2015
    -----------------------------------
    [x] new FFmpeg builds (from v2.8) extending support to 64bit CPUs

This beta is available through the in app updates, from settings, using the [Include Beta updates](http://dentex.github.io/blog/2014-07-15/new-beta-program-again/) preference checkbox, while *[link removed - old beta]* is the direct apk link.

Although I thoroughly tested all builds on all supported SDK versions, be advised that we're talking about a beta anyway; some rough edges are to be expected.
