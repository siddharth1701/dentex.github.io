This latest point version of YTD is aimed to fix a regression I accidentally introduced with version 4.4, that is was preventing the downloads count notification to be updated in real time; instead it was working only when entering the main app activity. Now has been fixed.

     v4.4.2 - Feb 15 2015
    -----------------------------------
    [x] fix downloads count in notification
    [x] many languages updated

[Download link](http://dentex.github.io/files/apk/latest/dentex.youtube.downloader.apk).

With this version, YTD will be again *soon* available through the Amazon app store with a dedicated build. The only caveats are that:
 - the in-app updates have been disabled (because they must be handled by Amazon store);
 - the "send via SSH" feature has been disabled also (because it relies on third party apps and download links not related to the Amazon store).
