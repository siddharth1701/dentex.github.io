This latest point version of YTD is aimed to fix a regression I accidentally introduced with version 4.4, that is was preventing the downloads count notification to be updated in real time; instead it was working only when entering the main app activity. Now has been fixed.

     v4.4.2 - Feb 15 2015
    -----------------------------------
    [x] fix downloads count in notification
    [x] many languages updated
