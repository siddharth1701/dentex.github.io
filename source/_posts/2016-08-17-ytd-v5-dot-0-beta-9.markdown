I made a couple of additional fix to the latest beta version:

Changelog:

     v5.0 Beta 9 - Aug 17 2016
    -----------------------------------
    [x] [COMPLETED]: multi-threaded downloads
    [x] [TO-DO]: global statistics in notification bar
    [x] [COMPLETED]: redundant "clear dashboard" button in action bar
    [x] [WIP]: dashboard sorting options
    
    [x] fix app crashes in Android N
    [x] better preview thumbnail in Formats tab
    [x] apply multi-threading also to the audio-only stream, 
        for videos requiring mux (480p and 1080p)
    [x] fix for the "shared?ci=" video-link type
    [x] fix for the progress bar during FFmpeg operations
    [x] use correct file extension for opus formats
    [x] support for ogg 4.0 ch. and m4a 5.1 ch. new audio-only formats
    [x] do not block age-restricted videos anymore 
        (please note: only some of them will be available for download)

As always, the Apk for this Beta is available through the in app updates (remember to enable the Beta updates channel) or via the direct link:    
http://dentex.github.io/files/apk/beta/dentex.youtube.downloader_v5.0-beta-9.apk

**Notes/known issues:**

- for this beta, dashboard sorting will be always "by size"    
- the download of the audio part for video requiring mux cannot be paused and if it breaks (if the system shuts down the app in background) it will remain broken.
(Those are the next items I will focus on; also, a better support for the external/removable sdcards is one of my next priorities).
