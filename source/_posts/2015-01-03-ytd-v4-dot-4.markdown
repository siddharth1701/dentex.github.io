YouTube Downloader version 4.4 is finally available! Download it [from this blog](http://dentex.github.io/files/apk/latest/dentex.youtube.downloader.apk) *[note: this link will always point to the latest stable version available]*.

Many new features has been tested in latest beta builds and now are available:

     v4.4 - Jan 03 2015
    -----------------------------------
    [x] configurable downloads queue
    [x] option to invert dashboard's entries click menus
    [x] auto-resume downloads paused due to network failure
    [x] new FFmpeg build targeting non-NEON CPUs (i.e. Tegra devices)
    [x] ability to send logcat to the developer via email
    [x] added Croatian, Indonesian (WIP) and Norwegian (WIP) translations
    [x] fixed dashboard rename with existing filename (thanks m0d)
    [x] back-button going through all tabs now as optional
    [x] new FFmpeg builds supporting Android L
    [x] keep screen on if something is "in progress"

I postponed the addition of a couple of features (a "de-queue now" option for dashboard entries and a "resume-all" action into the dashboard's sliding menu), to be able to push this version sooner; I'll add them later on, in a future 4.4.1 version.
