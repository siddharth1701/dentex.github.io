Yet another beta from the `v4.4` series.    
This time merging the download fix from YTD v4.3.3 (latest stable) plus some small extras (as some test versions of the FFmpeg executables supporting new Android versions, starting from **L**, due to a new security feature.    
Please note, **these FFmpeg builds are on test** and might not work.

The apk file is available for download through the app itself, enabling the [proper preference](http://dentex.github.io/blog/2014-07-15/new-beta-program-again/), or downloading directly the apk from [HERE](http://dentex.github.io/files/apk/beta/dentex.youtube.downloader_v4.4-beta-7.apk).
