Hello! This is a new beta to let you test again the multi-threaded download feature (plus some minor/hidden fixes)

**Notes/known issues:**

- for this beta, dashboard sorting will be always "by size"
- FFmpeg operations don't show progress
- in some circumstances, dashboard may seem unresponsive (probably when something is *in queue* and/or other things *in progress*)

Changelog:

     v5.0 Beta 7 - Feb 26 2016
    -----------------------------------
    [x] [WIP]: multi-threaded downloads
