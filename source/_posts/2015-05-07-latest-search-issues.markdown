Many of you may have already noticed that YTD's search function is no longer working. This is happening because Google discontinued search APIs functions some hours ago. This part of the app needs to be rewritten. 

Not that I didn't know this, but I haven't been able to patch the app in time.

For the moment, in the official YouTube app use the "share" function towards YouTube Downloader: this will open the formats tab directly (unless the video is not supported - see release notes).

This issue will be hopefully fixed with the next release.
