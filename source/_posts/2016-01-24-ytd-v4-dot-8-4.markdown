Hello,    
a user (thanks Eduardo!) spotted an awful bug: on Lollipop devices where you can't directly write on extSdCard, if you try to move a downloaded file from standard memory storage to this sdcard, the file will get lost. So I added a small fix.

Changelog:

     v4.8.4 - Jan 24 2016
    -----------------------------------
    [x] if device/ROM doesn't support direct writing to extSdCard, disable custom download location
    [x] support for file copy/move/rename/delete on extSdCard (Lollipop and above)
