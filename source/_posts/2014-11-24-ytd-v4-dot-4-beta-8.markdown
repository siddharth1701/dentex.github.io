Latest development changes are available in this new beta: to minimize the issue regarding the Andriod system closing YTD while downloading in background, now the screen will remain **on** as long as the user keeps the app to the front. In addition, I improved the *send logcat* feature.

Changelog:

     v4.4-beta-8 - Nov 23 2014
    -----------------------------------
    [x] configurable downloads queue
    [x] option to invert dashboard's entries click menus
    [x] auto-resume downloads paused due to network failure
    [x] new FFmpeg build targeting non-NEON CPUs (i.e. Tegra devices)
    [x] ability to send logcat to the developer via email
    [x] added Croatian, Indonesian (WIP) and Norwegian (WIP) translations
    [x] fixed dashboard rename with existing filename (thanks m0d)
    [x] back-button going through all tabs now as optional
    [x] new FFmpeg builds supporting Android L
    [x] keep screen on when anything is "in progress"

Still something to do, for a final stable version 4.4:

- a "dequeue now" option for dashboard entries;
- better downloads auto-resume and auto-queue on app start / "resume-all" function into the sliding menu.

And further down the road:

- Kitkat sdcard workaround / Lollipop new sdcard access feature;
- ...and many other things.
