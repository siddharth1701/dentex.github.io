In regards to the [Latest Search Issues](http://dentex.github.io/blog/2015-05-07/latest-search-issues/), a new fixed version is almost done; in the meantime, there was a beta version to test the new search feature available only over the XDA forum's beta thread: http://forum.xda-developers.com/showthread.php?t=2335450

Now I'm releasing a second BETA and it's available through the app's settings (update section).

If you want to download and test it, remember to switch **ON** the [preference activating beta updates](http://dentex.github.io/blog/2014-07-15/new-beta-program-again/), otherwise it will not be visible and downloadable.

This is the latest changelog:

     v4.5 Beta-2 - May 21 2015
    -----------------------------------
    [x] new and working integrated search (with filters menu)
    [x] Bulgarian and Romanian translations (as WIP), many other updated

    [x] wrap extracted aac audio-only into an m4a container
    [x] many libraries updated (OkHttp added)
    [x] better error handling during update check
