With this new *stable* and *beta* versions, I'm adding another fix that has been discovered yesterday. In regards, I'd like to thank all the users/testers for their support and help (especially spotting new bugs!).

    -----------------------------------
    [x] [WIP]: multi-threaded downloads
    [x] [TO-DO]: global statistics in notification bar
    [x] [COMPLETED]: redundant "clear dashboard" button in action bar
    [x] [TEMP]: fix for showed total file size in Dashboard (thanks  KreNtal @XDA)

     v4.8.2 - Nov 22 2015
    -----------------------------------
    [x] support for 2160p/2304p MP4 VO streams
