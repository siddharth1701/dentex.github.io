Hi!
Has been a long time. I hope to be more active in the next future. Hopefully I will continue to fix bugs and add more features to this app.
So, for the moment a new beta it's ready and this is the changelog:

     v5.0 Beta 8 - Aug 16 2016
    -----------------------------------
    [x] [COMPLETED]: multi-threaded downloads
    [x] [TO-DO]: global statistics in notification bar
    [x] [COMPLETED]: redundant "clear dashboard" button in action bar
    [x] [WIP]: dashboard sorting options
    
    [x] apply multi-threading also to the audio-only stream, 
        for videos requiring mux (480p and 1080p)
    [x] fix for the "shared?ci=" video-link type
    [x] fix for the progress bar during FFmpeg operations
    [x] use correct file extension for opus formats
    [x] support for ogg 4.0 ch. and m4a 5.1 ch. new audio-only formats

As always, the Apk for this Beta is available through the in app updates (remember to enable the Beta updates channel) or via the direct link:    
http://dentex.github.io/files/apk/beta/dentex.youtube.downloader_v5.0-beta-8.apk

**Notes/known issues:**

- for this beta, dashboard sorting will be always "by size"    
(This is the next item I will focus on; also, a better support for the external/removable sdcards is one of my next priorities).
