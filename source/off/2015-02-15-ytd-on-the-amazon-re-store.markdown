Sorry for the cheap pun :)

A dedicated YTD build has been again made available on the Amazon app store. Just check the link below in a few hours.

[![amazon_link](/images/others/amazon-icon.png)](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00BGF3LFE)

With this version, the only caveats are that:
- the in-app updates have been disabled (because they must be handled by Amazon store);
- the "send via SSH" feature has been disabled also (because it relies on third party apps and download links not related to the Amazon store).
