`versionName="4.3.3.1_v4.4-beta-7"`

SHA1 checksum: `@@@`

Yet another beta from the `v4.4` series. This time merging the download fix from YTD v4.3.3 (latest stable) plus some small extras (as some test versions of the FFmpeg executables supporting new Android version starting from `L`, due to a new security feature [please note that **this is on test** and might not work]).

Take a look at the the Changelog below.
